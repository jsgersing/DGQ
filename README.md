# DynamicGMATQuestions

## Introduction

This project is a proof-of-concept: to create a simple app with a U/I that provides semi-randomly generated practice questions for the GMAT quantitative section.

## Future Stages
Immediate plans include creating a field with tips or explanations. 
Future plans include breaking down questions by type, tracking user progress and making suggestions for additional study based on the data collected.
