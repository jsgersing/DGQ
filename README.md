# DynamicGMATQuestions

## Introduction

This project is a proof-of-concept: to create a simple app with a UI that provides semi-randomly generated practice questions for the GMAT quantitative section.

[Click to see the app in action on Heroku](https://dynamic-gmat-questions.herokuapp.com/)

[Or on Elastic Beanstalk](http://dynamicgmatquestions-env.eba-mkg7vd6y.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
## Future Stages
Immediate plans include creating a field with tips or explanations. 
Future plans include breaking down questions by type, tracking user progress and making suggestions for additional study based on the data collected.
